    <p>From a strong technical foundation built during my vocational education in Computer Technology, I pursued my passion for systems and infrastructure. Starting my career at Speedy JSC as an Information Systems Administrator, I quickly dove into database administration, scripting, and enterprise IT support. My natural curiosity and drive for efficiency led me to automation and DevOps practices.</p>
    <p>Over time, I mastered tools like Ansible, Kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD, and cloud services like Azure, eventually transitioning into my current role as a DevOps Engineer. Today, I build and maintain scalable, secure infrastructures and drive automation across hybrid environments. I thrive on solving complex infrastructure challenges and pushing technology forward within enterprise ecosystems.</p>
